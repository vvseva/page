In the summer of 2021, I got an internship at the most heavily loaded social networking service in post-soviet space -- [vk.com](https://vk.com/about).

All the research results are summed up in this video:

It is in Russian, but if you really interested you could something out.

# Skills

Tons of big data instruments: starting with a ClickHouse and Hadoop with pySpark and following up with AirFlow (DAGs !) Kafka, Azkaban and Zeppelin. Extracting and processing files that were larger then my laptop hard drive was a challenge, but elegant sampling saved the day.

# Personal thoughts

Industry might be challenging and the majority of co-workers are not keening to teach you something. And that is completely understandable, but mildly infuriating. 

I understood that getting bogged down in a routine is not always a bad thing, but that is not something that I want to to now.
