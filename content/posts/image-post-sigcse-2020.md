I was very excited to participate in my first ACM conference, but it was shuttled down due to COVID-19 a day before the start.

> The introductory agent-based modeling course we are presenting aims to equip second-year sociology students with basic skills which are critical to transforming their research ideas into theories and computational models. 
> Our course follows a general course on theory construction in social science. As one of the first interactions of undergraduate social science students with computer science concepts, the course partially serves as a CS0 course; however, the main focus is on the higher-level skills needed to model social phenomena. This requires the course to maintain multiple foci on computer science and domain skills. 
> In this paper, we present a course design considerations and establish a foundation for the comparison of agent-based models and the computational thinking and CS0 skills required for undergraduate social scientists studying agent-based modeling.

I was also supposed to volunteer at the conference but did not check in the day before the conference. At least I participated in the CodePost workshop and got my GitHub education bag. I took three of them since the organizers asked us to help with the leftovers, and they were going to recycle them anyway. It was one of the best souvenirs I ever obtained, so bags were gifted to friends.

You can find a [poster here](/pdf/SIGCSE2020.pdf). And single page paper is available at ACM [Teaching Undergraduate Sociologists Modeling and Computational Thinking](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3328778.3372687). It is also on ResearchGate, or you could just email me.
