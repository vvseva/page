---

Putin invaded Ukraine

# English

> The war has been going on for eight years; just remember who started it
> Rugged half-men in plastic uniforms are no longer scary because half-men attacked Ukraine in kevlar, and the people there are braver and will win
> The half-men will come back, get heroes of Putin's Russia*, get pensions at 30, and those who have been awarded the Order of the Moon maybe even at 25. And then they will start shooting in basements in the back; why Not? 99% has agreed. Or no one was against it
> Russia of people has already lost and will soon find itself locked in with the monsters, who will have the Miratorg's benefits and subsidized stays in a sanatorium in Gelendzhik. That's when it will be scary, but it's still Dusk
> And now you can still prove, at least to yourself, that you are not on the side of Putin's Russia\*. So don't be afraid to take to the streets. Don't be scared to stop Putin's Russia\* from killing people. Or pray.

> \* Putin's Russia attacked Ukraine on the night of February 24 without a declaration of war


# Russian

> Война идёт восемь лет, только помните, кто её развязал
> Суровые мужички в пластмассовой форме больше не пугают, ведь, на Украину напали мужички в кевларе, а люди там смелее, и победят
> Мужички вернутся, получат героев Путинской России*, пенсии лет в 30, а награждённые орденом луны может и в 25. А потом начнут стрелять в подвалах в спину, ну а чего, 99% же согласны. Или никто не был против
> Россия обычная уже проиграла и вскоре окажется запертой с монстрами, у которых будет льгота на Мираторг и путёвки в санаторий в Геленджике. Вот тогда будет страшно, а сейчас ещё сумерки
> А сейчас ещё можно доказать хотя бы самому себе, что вы не на стороне Путинской России\*. Не бойтесь выходить на улицы. Не бойтесь мешать Путинской России\* убивать людей. Ну или молитесь.

>\* Путинская Россия в ночь на 24 февраля без объявления войны напала на Украину

# Personal thoughts

As a Russian citizen. I am sorry. I have never voted for Putin, futhermore I supported these bits of opposition that were left, I participated in PEACEFUL protests, where we were bitten by police that covered their faces and IDs. Until yesterday I wasn't ashamed. These were extremely ugly political moves, but still political. 

A few days I still could have said that some kind of they were bad. They silently support this government. They were sceptical about the protests. They did not support human rights media and organizations that the government is actively trying to shut down.

But I am paying the taxes. Taxes that for the last few years supported arming the army with new weapons to kill innocent people from Ukraine.

But I just lived my life like nothing is happening in the tyranny of the state that no one chose.

Now I feel guilty for not doing enough, but the problem is that I have no idea what am I supposed to do now. I am scared. Fuck war. Fuck Putin. Fuck Putin's Russia.
