title: 'Toloka Research Grant for MA Thesis'
---

I was very excited to participate in my first ACM conference, but it was shuttled down due to COVID-19 a day before the start.

### How will the research idea benefit from the grant?

> Our study intends to explore different mechanisms of supporting sustained contributions in urban citizen science projects. The concept of situational decision-making assumes that motivation plays a role and is mediated by decision-making context and mental schemas, which, in our case, are connected to the perception of the urban environment.
> Access to crowdsourcing input will allow us to get insight into factors behind peopleâ€™s mental mapping of the urban spaces. We will recruit participants for behavioural experiments and factorial surveys, uncovering factors behind mental maps. In addition, crowdsourcing will allow us to access a geographically and socio-demographically diverse population of participants, overcoming the limitations of traditional convenience samples.
> Some particular examples of tasks are using crowdsource workers to elicit local attractions perception coordinates, i.e. local vs tourist, quiet vs crowded, etc., and discovering a new dimension of actual human perception of locations. Putting humans in the loop will increase the ecological validity of our study compared to the analysis of user-generated data.

[Toloka](https://toloka.ai/) is mostly a crowdsource platform for mapping datasets for ML, but toloka workers are real individuals, who as many other people could effectively estimate the power and invasiveness of nudging messages. More about [Toloka Academi](https://toloka.ai/academy).
