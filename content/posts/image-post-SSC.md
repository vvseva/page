Well... that was one more weird experience, since I had almost no idea what I was doing at that conference. I have read zero ABM papers, missed half of the workshop where real AMB people discussed the use of theories for building ABMs. So that is the presentation, which I had not touched:

However, I interviewed Milena Tsvetkova for about an hour about her research and academic path for WDL project. That interview was even published on our channel, take a look!
