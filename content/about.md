## Short

Please call me Seva; here is my [CV](https://github.com/vvseva/cv/raw/master/Vsevolod_Suschevskiy_resume.pdf).

In general, I like what Computational Social Science is, especially inferring human behaviour either with Agent-Based Modeling and/or digital experiments (virtual labs, maybe), where social structure might be represented as a network.

## Long

In Summer 2022, I started being a [Technology and Social Behaviour](https://tsb.northwestern.edu/) at Northwestern University Grad Student and a research assistant at [SONIC](http://sonic.northwestern.edu/). I will be working on human-AI interactions.

Before that, I worked as a research assistant at [Universitetet i Bergen](https://www.uib.no/en/persons/Vsevolod.Suschevskiy). Together with Mohammad Khalil at [SLATE](https://slate.uib.no/), we created [CERES](https://ceres.apps.slate.uib.no/experiment/) -- a custom build digital lab for experiments. We even published a [paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350874550_Creating_a_Course_Recommendation_System_for_Exchange_Students) about the first iteration, but we also managed to launch and analyze a pilot experiment with real students. Furthermore, we worked on analyzing classroom intervention with mixed models and SEMs. _(one day it will be published)_

Also, I was a moderate [Computer'ish Science](https://spb.hse.ru/en/ma/computer/) student at HSE University. My scientific adviser is Ilya Musabirov, and my thesis will explore the effect of motivation and social influence in Citizen Science with the help of conjoint analysis, a.k.a. wiki survey.

Lastly, but not for the amount of time it required, I worked as (1) an invited co-lecturer at [Data Science minor](https://electives.hse.ru/minor_data_spb/) at the same HSE University. The course was mostly a mix of CSS and intro to data science for non-STEM students, so we are talking about _tidyverse_, _tidymodels_, and _shiny_. In addition, (2) an invited lecturer for a graduate-level course -- Into to Small Data Science for Political Science students. And (3) an invited co-lecturer for a Data Visualization course with [Anastasia Kuznetsova](https://t.me/nastengraph) at [European University at St. Petersburg](https://eusp.org/programs/applied-data-analysis). _(At some point, some materials will be available at [courses](/courses/))_
