## Short

I am [Vsevolod Suschevskiy](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1361052510958542855/gUR5YxX8_400x400.jpg), but please call me Seva in order to save your speech apparatus, so here is my [CV](https://github.com/vvseva/cv/raw/master/Vsevolod_Suschevskiy_sCV.pdf). 

In general, I like what Computational Social Science is, especially, inferring human behavior either with Agent-Based Modeling and/or digital experiments, where social structure might be represented as a network.

## Long

I worked as a research assistant at [Universitetet i Bergen](https://www.uib.no/en/persons/Vsevolod.Suschevskiy). Together with Mohammad Khalil at [SLATE](https://slate.uib.no/) we created [CERES](https://ceres.apps.slate.uib.no/experiment/) -- a custom build digital lab for experiments. We even published a [paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350874550_Creating_a_Course_Recommendation_System_for_Exchange_Students) about the first iteration, but we also managed to launch and analyzed a pilot experiment with real students. Futhermore, we worked on the analysis of classroom intervention with mixed models and SEMs.

Also, I am a moderate [Computer'ish Science](https://spb.hse.ru/en/ma/computer/) student at HSE University. My scientific adviser is Ilya Musabirov and thesis is going to explore the effect of motivation, social influence in Citizen Science with the help of conjoint analysis a.k.a. wiki survey.

My second role is an instructor at Data Science minor at the same Uni. It is mostly a mix of CSS and intro to data science for non-STEM students, so we are talking about _tidyverse_, _tidymodels_, and _shiny_.
