I am Vsevolod Suschevskiy, but i will ask you to call me Seva to save your jaw. How about taking a look at my [CV](https://github.com/vvseva/cv/raw/master/Vsevolod_Suschevskiy_sCV.pdf)

I worked as a research assistant at [Universitetet i Bergen](https://www.uib.no/en/persons/Vsevolod.Suschevskiy). Together with Mohammad Khalil at [SLATE](https://slate.uib.no/) we created [CERES](https://ceres.apps.slate.uib.no/experiment/) -- a custom build digital lab for experiments. We even published a [paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/350874550_Creating_a_Course_Recommendation_System_for_Exchange_Students) about the first iteration, but we also managed to launched and analyzed a pilot experiment with real students.

Also, I am a moderate [Computer'ish Science](https://spb.hse.ru/en/ma/computer/) student at HSE University. My scientific adviser is Ilya Musabirov and thesis is going to explore the effect of motivation, social influence in Citizen Science with the help of conjoint analysis a.k.a. wiki survey.

My third role is as an instructor at Data Science minor at the same Uni. It is mostly social data science for non-STEM student, so we are talking about _tidyverse_ and _shiny_.
