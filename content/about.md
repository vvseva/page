I am Vsevolod Suschevskiy, but i will ask you to call me Seva to save your jaw. How about taking a look at my [CV](https://github.com/vvseva/cv/raw/master/Vsevolod_Suschevskiy_sCV.pdf)

I am a research assitant at [Universitetet i Bergen](https://www.uib.no/en/persons/Vsevolod.Suschevskiy). Where I work with Mohammad Khalil at [SLATE](https://slate.uib.no/) on [CERES](https://ceres.apps.slate.uib.no/experiment/) -- a custom build digital lab for experiments.

Also, I am a moderate [HCI](https://spb.hse.ru/en/ma/computer/) student at HSE University. My scientific advisor is Ilya Musabirov and thesis is _TBO_.

My third role is as an instructor at Data Science minor at the same Uni. It is mostly social data science for non-STEM student, so we are talking about _tidyverse_ and _shiny_.
